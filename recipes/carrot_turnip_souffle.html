<h1>Carrot and turnip souffle</h1>

Carrot and turnip are great in combination, but this recipe can be used with either vegetable, or any root vegetable, by itself as well. <br/><br/>

1 lb. carrots, chopped<br/>
1 lb. turnips, peeled and chopped<br/>
1 cup milk<br/>
1/2 cup flour of your choice<br/>
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese<br/>
1 tbs. butter<br/>
1/4 cup finely chopped onion<br/>
2 eggs, beaten<br/>
1 tsp. salt<br/>
1/4 tsp. black pepper<br/>
pinch cayenne pepper<br/><br/>

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the carrots and turnips in a saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a boil a simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, and place in a food processor.<br/>

Add the butter, milk and eggs, and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and stir in first the flour, salt, pepper and cayenne, and then the grated cheese and onion. Pour the souffl√© into a buttered 2-quart baking dish or glass pie plate, and bake for 40-45 minutes, until puffed up and lightly golden. Serves 4.
