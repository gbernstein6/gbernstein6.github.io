<h1>Ethan's Pickles</h1>

Well you want to make sure you are getting the right type of cucumbers. The ones I get at the farmerâ€™s market are called pickling cucumbers, but I think they are Bush Cucumbers.</br></br>

After you have them, wash thoroughly, cut off the tips, and quarter. When they are quartered, salt heavily and let sit. This will draw the water out of the cucumber. Wipe down with a paper towel after letting them sit for 15 min.</br></br>

In the meantime, start your brine on the stove. I use 3 cups of water to 2 cups of white wine vinegar. That will make enough for 2 mason jars. Put over medium heat with a little over a tablespoon of salt and a little under a table spoon of sugar. Make sure your salt is either sea salt or pickling salt. Once its boiling and combined, turn stove off and let cool.</br></br>

In jars, put a healthy amount of fresh dill, multiple cloves of garlic (both chopped and whole are good), I like adding Habanero peppers, 1 with seeds and 1 without, chopped. You can add peppercorn or other flavors if you want.</br></br>

Add cucumbers to jar and pour brine in jars once room temperature. Keep closed for at least 24 hours. 48 hours is better. Then they are good to eat
