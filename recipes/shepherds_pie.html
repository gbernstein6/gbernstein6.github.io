<h1>Vegetarian shepherd's pie with sweet potato topping</h1>

3 tbs. olive oil<br/>
1 tbs. tamari/soy sauce<br/>
1 lb. tempeh, crumbled<br/>
1 large leek onion<br/>
4 garlic cloves, minced<br/>
2 cups diced carrot<br/>
2 cups diced celery root<br/>
1/2 tsp. dried thyme (or 1 tsp. fresh)<br/>
1/2 tsp. dried sage (or 1 tsp. fresh)<br/>
1/2 tsp. salt<br/>
a few grinds place pepper <br/><br/>

2 lbs. sweet potatoes<br/>
2 tbs. butter<br/>
1/2 cup milk or coconut milk<br/>
1 tsp. salt<br/>

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a large skillet, heat 2 tbs. olive oil and saut√© the leek, carrot, celery root and garlic until tender. Add the herbs, salt and pepper and cook 1 minute more.  Heat the remaining 1 tbs. of olive oil in another skillet (or push your vegetable mixture to the side in the same skillet, if large enough).  Brown the crumbled tempeh over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes.  Add the tamari to the tempeh, then add to the vegetables.<br/><br/>

You can peel the sweet potatoes or leave the skins on. Cut the sweet potato into chunks and put them in a medium saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer until very soft, 20-25 minutes. Drain and mash with the butter, milk and salt.<br/><br/>

Spread the tempeh mixture into the bottom of a 9 x 12 baking dish. Spoon the mashed sweet potatoes on top and gently spread them over the tempeh layer. Bake uncovered for 30-40 minutes, until top is golden.  Serves 6.
