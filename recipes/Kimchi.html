<b>Directions</b></br>
1. Quarter each cabbage length-wise, remove core, then cut length-wise once more (into eighths). Cut each eighth crosswise into thirds. Soak cabbage, then drain. Toss with 6 tbsp of salt and 1 cup water. Let stand for 2 hours, tossing every 30 minutes to distribute salt. Meanwhile, make paste and prep vegetables.</br>
2. For the porridge, combine flour and veggie stock (or water) in a small saucepan an place over medium-high heat. Stir until mixture begins to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 tbsp sugar and stir until mixture is slightly translucent and has the consistency of a runny porridge, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool thoroughly.</br>
3. Puree cooled porridge, garlic, onion, ginger, pear, shrimp, fish sauce, 1 tbsp kosher salt, and 1 tsp sugar in food processor. Transfer to large bowl.</br>
4. Stir in 1 cup gochugaru, then mix in vegetables.</br>
5. When cabbage is done salting, drain and rinse several times with cold water, then drain.</br>
6. Mix cabbage into vegetable/paste mixture, then transfer to airtight jars, making sure to press out all air bubbles.</br>
7. Kimchi can be eaten fresh. For fermentation, leave at room temp for 1 to 3 days, depending on warmth of room, then transfer to fridge. Transfers can be staggered over a few days to offset fermentation levels. Fermented Kimchi will be ready after roughly 2 weeks, but feel free to check regularly.</br>
