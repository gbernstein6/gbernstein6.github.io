cover 8-12 chicken thighs in water, boil the hell out of them (in lightly salted water +/- a heaping teaspoon or 2 to taste)</br>
Let the whole mess cool a bit, then remove the thighs when you can handle them and seperate out the eatable part of the chicken into bite sizes. Store in fridge.</br>
Pour the broth (through a strainer if necessary, i.e., if it's yuchy) into containers and cool in fridge (over night) until the fat layer rises to the top and can be removed.</br>
</br>
Next day:</br>
Remove the fat layer of the broth.</br>
Chop veggies into bite sizes (4 - 8 leeks, 4 - 8 medium-large carrots, a bunch or 2 of parsley, one medium parsnip, and maybe some other root-like veggie lite rutabaga, turnip or what ever)</br>
While chopping the veggies, pre-cook a bunch of mini-noodles (little tiny strings, alphabet soup noodles, orzo or similar) and add ONLY AT THE LAST MINUTE before eating that evening's portion.</br>
Back to the veggies: Boil them (without the chicken) in yesterday's chicken broth along with 2 cans of ready made chicken soup broth.</br>
Do NOT boil the hell out of this brew since it will cause the veggies to desintegrate (bring to a boil, then try simmering for 25 - 30 minutes for starters).</br>
Add the pre morselized chicken and salt and pepper to taste.</br>
Store what you're not going to eat at that meal and add the pre-cooked noodles to the part you are going to eat just then.</br>
</br>
For the record: most people only put the parsley in for taste and don't serve it in the soup. I either leave it in the soup (whole little branches) or fish them out and eat them as a seperate veggie.</br>
You do know Norman's "nobody eats parsley anymore" joke, don't you? (What's the difference between parsely and pussy? Nobody eats parsley anymore)</br>
