The problem with giving this recipe to you is that there are no quantities involved, I eyeball it all, so this will be a rough estimate.<br/><br/>

For every 1 pound of ground beef that you use (and it should be 80/20 ground beef, not LEAN.  Fatty is better for sauces and stews):<br/><br/>

1 medium onion, chopped medium size<br/>
1 clove of garlic, minced<br/>
1 (6oz) can of tomato paste<br/>
1 large can (as big as it comes, maybe 32 oz? maybe 24oz?) of crushed tomatoes (try not to get seasoned ones, because you're going to season them yourself)<br/>
1 large can (same as the one before) of tomato sauce<br/>
1/4 cup of red wine (or however much you want, but don't overdo it on the first go, you have to add it slowly and let it mix in and burn off before you can tell what it's going to taste like)<br/><br/>

spices are basil, oregano, parsley, bay leaves, thyme, salt, pepper, sugar<br/>
- note on the spices:  go easy on the thyme, salt, and sugar.  add them slowly, mixing and tasting, or you might ruin the sauce - they are very powerful.<br/>
- a rough idea of proportions:   1 tbsp of basil, 1 tbsp of oregano, 1 tbsp parsley (or more), 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp thyme.  pepper to taste.<br/><br/>

Chop the Onion(s), and saute in 1 tbsp olive oil (per onion) over medium-high heat until onions soften and start to turn translucent.<br/>
Add the garlic, lower heat to medium, cook for about 1 minute.<br/>
Add ground beef, mix it all up and cook until brown. <br/>
Add the tomato paste, mix it in<br/>
Add the crushed tomatoes, mix them in<br/>
Add the tomato sauce, mix it all in<br/>
Add the spices in no particular order, but add the sugar last<br/>
Add the wine (you might want more than 1/4 cup per pound of beef, I said that to be safe.  You also want the wine to by Dry wine)<br/><br/>

Bring to a boil over medium heat and then reduce to a simmer for at LEAST 40 minutes, about 3/4 covered but not fully covered.  Stir every 10 mins or so to prevent it from burning on the bottom.<br/><br/>

It will taste better if you let it sit overnight before eating it.
