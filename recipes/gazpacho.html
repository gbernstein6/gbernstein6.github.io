<h1>Classic gazpacho- chilled tomato soup</h1>

<p>
2 lbs. ripe red tomatoes</br>
1 medium sized green pepper</br>
1 medium sized cucumber</br>
1/4 cup chopped red or sweet onion</br>
1 large or 2 small cloves garlic, chopped</br>
2 slices stale bread, torn into pieces (optional)</br>
2 tbs. red wine or apple cider vinegar</br>
1/4 cup good quality olive oil</br>
salt and pepper to taste</br>
a few pinches ground toasted cumin or smoked paprika, optional</br>
</p>
Cut the vegetables into large chunks.  Neatly dice a small amount of the cucumber and green pepper and reserve for a garnish.  Pulse the tomato and bread, if using, in the bowl of a blender or food processor, until combined.  Omitting the bread will simply result in a thinner soup.  Add all other ingredients except olive oil, blend to desired consistency.  Add the olive oil in a slow stream while the blender is running.  Taste and add more salt, pepper, spices or vinegar if needed.  The soup can be served immediately but the flavor improves as it chills and site on the fridge.  Ideally chill for 2 hours or overnight.  Serves 3-4.
