<h1>Kombucha</h1>

Yields 5-6 17oz bottles</br>

<h2>Ingredients</h2></br>
<b>Tea</b></br>
&#x2022; 1 gallon water</br>
&#x2022; 1 cup sugar</br>
&#x2022; 8 black tea bags</br>

</br><b>Flavorings</b></br>
&#x2022; Dealers choice, a couple strips of ginger and a some blueberries is a favorite</br>

</br><b>Equipment</b></br>
&#x2022; 1 gallon glass jug</br>
&#x2022; 5-6 17oz tall skinny capped glass bottles (vary size/number as you like but you want to fill it up to a thin neck and a stopper to ensure carbonation; 
  less surface area exposed to air is better)</br>
&#x2022; large pot for boiling tea </br>
&#x2022; funnel </br>
&#x2022; bottle brush for occassional deep cleaning </br>

</br><h2>Directions</h2></br>

<b>Prepare new tea</b></br>
1. Boil 1 gallon water to make tea with 8 black tea bags and 1 cup sugar. Exact method doesn’t really matter. Let cool. </br>


</br><b>Bottle fermented tea</b></br>
2. Put flavoring into bottles. Can soap the bottles but don't worry too much about deep scrubs every time in between batches.</br></br>

3. Take mother out of previous batch in gallon jug and set aside. Reserve 2 cups of the fermented tea. Decant the rest of the fermented tea into the prepared bottles. </br></br>

4. Set capped kombucha bottles aside at room temp for a day or two, depending on your preference of carbonation (and accounting for summer/winter room temp). 
    </br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8212; Consider storing on a baking sheet in case carbonation forces leakage.
    </br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8212; Make sure not to over-carbonate, especially during warmer months, to ensure bottles don’t break and burst. 
    </br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8212; Move to fridge to halt carbonation. </br></br>

</br><b>Bottle new tea</b></br>

5. Put reserved 2 cups fermented tea back in gallon jug, no need to soap, along with cooled new tea and mother. 
    </br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8212; The reserved fermented tea is to ensure new tea acidity starts high enough to prevent bad bacteria. </br></br>

6. Cover with a kitchen towel and a rubber band so mother can breathe but bugs can’t get in and set gallon jug aside at room temp for a week or so.
    </br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8212; This step depends on your preference of fermentation (and accounting for summer/winter room temp). 
    </br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8212; The longer it ferments with the mother the less sweet and  the more vinegary it will become.
    </br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8212; This is now the gallon jug you’ll use back at the beginning of the recipe. </br></br>

7. To drink, optionally filter kombucha through mesh screen to catch flavorings and accumulated goop, serve cold, and enjoy!
